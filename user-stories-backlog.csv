US-001,User Authentication via Google Auth & Magic Link,Story,"As a user, I want to sign in using my Google account or a magic link sent to my email, so that I can securely access the application without managing a separate password.","Google Authentication:
- Given I am on the sign-in screen, when I tap ""Sign in with Google,"" then I am redirected to Google's OAuth flow and returned to the app upon successful authentication.
- Given I complete Google OAuth, when my account does not yet exist, then a new account is created automatically using my Google profile info (name, email, avatar).
- Given I complete Google OAuth, when my account already exists, then I am signed in and taken to the main dashboard/home screen.
- Given the Google OAuth flow fails or is cancelled, when I return to the app, then I see a clear error message and remain on the sign-in screen.

Magic Link (Email):
- Given I am on the sign-in screen, when I enter a valid email address and tap ""Send Magic Link,"" then a one-time sign-in link is sent to that email address.
- Given I receive the magic link email, when I tap the link within its expiration window (e.g., 15 minutes), then I am authenticated and redirected into the app.
- Given the magic link has expired, when I tap it, then I see a message indicating it has expired with an option to request a new one.
- Given I enter an email not associated with an existing account, when I tap ""Send Magic Link,"" then a new account is created upon first successful sign-in via that link.
- Given I request multiple magic links, when I use any one of them, then all previously issued links for that email are invalidated.

General / Session:
- Given I am authenticated (via either method), when I return to the app within the session window, then I remain signed in without needing to re-authenticate.
- Given my session has expired, when I attempt to access a protected screen, then I am redirected to the sign-in screen.
- Given I am signed in, when I tap ""Sign out,"" then my session is terminated and I am returned to the sign-in screen.","- What is the session duration before expiry?
- Should we support additional OAuth providers in future (Apple, Microsoft)?

US-002,"User-Level Analytics — Login Events, Dashboard Behavior & Session Recurrence",Story,"As a product owner, I want to track individual user login events, dashboard interactions via heat maps, and session recurrence intervals, so that I can understand user engagement patterns and make data-driven decisions to improve the product.","Platform Selection:
- Given the need for login event tracking, heat maps, and session recurrence metrics, when evaluating analytics platforms, then a comparison is documented covering at least three candidates against criteria including: user-level (non-aggregate) tracking, heat map support, session replay, custom event/metric support, pricing, and GDPR compliance.
- Given the evaluation is complete, when a platform is selected, then the decision and rationale are documented and approved before implementation.

Login Event Tracking:
- Given a user signs in (via Google Auth or Magic Link), when authentication succeeds, then a login event is recorded with: user ID, timestamp, authentication method, device type, and IP-derived location.
- Given login events are being captured, when I access the analytics dashboard, then I can view total logins per user, logins over a configurable time range, and filter/segment by auth method and device.
- Given a login attempt fails, when the failure occurs, then a failed login event is recorded with the reason.

Dashboard Heat Map:
- Given a user is interacting with the application dashboard, when they click, scroll, or hover, then those interactions are captured and available as a heat map visualization.
- Given heat map data is collected, when I view the analytics platform, then I can filter heat maps by user segment, device type, and date range.
- Given heat map data is collected, when I review it, then I can identify the most and least interacted-with areas of the dashboard.

Session Recurrence Interval:
- Given a user has multiple sessions, when I view their analytics profile, then I can see the average interval between sessions.
- Given recurrence data is available, when I view it at the cohort/aggregate level, then I can see distribution of recurrence intervals across all users.
- Given a user's recurrence interval changes significantly, when I review the data, then I can identify the trend over time via a time-series view.

Data & Privacy:
- Given analytics are being collected, when a user is tracked, then all data collection complies with the application's privacy policy and applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
- Given a user requests data deletion, when the request is processed, then their analytics data is also purged from the analytics platform.","- Should heat maps include session replay, or strictly click/scroll heat maps?
- What is the minimum recurrence interval resolution — daily, hourly?
- Do we need real-time dashboards, or is batch/daily refresh acceptable?
- Should recurrence interval trigger automated alerts (e.g., churn risk)?
- Depends on US-004 (Analytics Spike) for platform selection.",,,High,"analytics, tracking, heat-map"
US-003,Product Feature Analytics — Creator Addition Tracking Per Account,Story,"As a product owner, I want to track how many creators each user account is adding, so that I can understand adoption depth, identify power users, and inform decisions around feature development and plan limits.","Creator Addition Event Tracking:
- Given a logged-in user adds a new creator, when the creator is successfully created, then an event is recorded with: user ID, timestamp, creator ID, and the method of creation.
- Given a logged-in user removes a creator, when the removal is confirmed, then a corresponding removal event is recorded with the same metadata.
- Given events are being captured, when I query the analytics platform, then I can see the net creator count per account over any time range.

Per-Account Creator Metrics:
- Given a user has added creators, when I view their account profile in the analytics dashboard, then I can see: total creators currently active, total creators ever added, total creators removed, and a timeline of additions/removals.
- Given I am reviewing accounts at the aggregate level, when I view the creator metrics report, then I can see: average creators per account, median, distribution histogram, and top accounts by creator count.

Segmentation & Trends:
- Given creator addition data is available, when I apply filters, then I can segment by account age, plan type, auth method, and time period.
- Given creator data is tracked over time, when I view the trend report, then I can see the rate of creator additions per account over weekly/monthly intervals.

Thresholds & Alerts:
- Given an account approaches a plan-defined creator limit, when they reach a configurable threshold (e.g., 80%), then the system logs a limit-approaching event that can trigger a notification or in-app prompt.
- Given an account hits the creator limit, when they attempt to add another, then the action is blocked and a limit-reached event is recorded.","- Are there different creator ""types"" that should be tracked separately?
- Should bulk imports be tracked as a single event or individual creator additions?
- Is there a current or planned creator limit per plan tier?
- Should this data feed into a customer health score or churn prediction model alongside session recurrence (US-002)?",,,High,"analytics, creators, product-metrics"
US-004,[SPIKE] Evaluate & Select Analytics Platform,Spike,"As a product owner, I want the team to evaluate analytics platform options and recommend the best fit for our user-level event tracking, heat map, and reporting needs, so that we can make an informed build/buy decision before implementing Stories US-002 and US-003.","Evaluation Framework:
- Given the three identified approaches (PostHog single platform, best-of-breed stack, warehouse-first), when the spike begins, then each option is evaluated against a documented scorecard covering: user-level tracking, heat map and session replay capability, custom metric support, dashboard/reporting quality, integration effort, GDPR/CCPA compliance, scalability at 6- and 12-month projections, and total cost of ownership.

Proof of Concept:
- Given a platform is shortlisted, when a lightweight POC is conducted, then it demonstrates: ingesting a sample login event, ingesting a sample creator-added event, querying per-user event counts, and rendering a basic heat map on a test page.

Heat Map Validation:
- Given heat map capability is critical, when evaluating each option, then the spike confirms support for: click/scroll/hover tracking, filtering by user segment and date range, and export/screenshot of heat map data.

Recurrence Interval Feasibility:
- Given session recurrence interval is a custom metric, when evaluating each platform, then the spike documents how each tool can compute average time between sessions per user — natively, via custom formula, or requiring external calculation.

Deliverable:
- Given the evaluation and POC are complete, when the spike concludes, then a written recommendation is delivered including: completed scorecard comparison, POC findings, recommended platform with rationale, known limitations, and estimated implementation effort for US-002 and US-003.

Decision Gate:
- Given the recommendation is delivered, when the team reviews it, then a go/no-go decision is made and documented before US-002 or US-003 moves into development.","- Do we have a preference for self-hosted vs. cloud-hosted analytics?
- Are there existing data warehouse or BI tools in the stack we should integrate with?
- What is the projected user volume at 6 and 12 months?
- Are there compliance or data residency requirements that rule out specific vendors?","US-002, US-003",3-5 days,Critical,"spike, analytics, platform-evaluation"
US-005,Subscription-Based Access Control & Tier Limit Enforcement via Payment Gateway,Story,"As a product owner, I want the application to enforce feature limits based on the user's pricing tier and manage access based on active subscription status, so that only paying users can access the product and usage stays within plan boundaries.","Payment Gateway Integration:
- Given the company is UK-based, when selecting a payment gateway, then the integration supports Stripe as primary, with consideration for UK-relevant alternatives (GoCardless, Paddle, Revolut Business Pay).
- Given a gateway is selected, when implemented, then it supports: GBP and at least USD/EUR, recurring billing (monthly/annual), automatic VAT/tax calculation for UK/EU, and webhook-based event notifications.

Subscription Lifecycle & Access Management:
- Given a user subscribes, when payment succeeds, then their account is activated with access to features corresponding to their tier.
- Given a user's subscription renews successfully, when the renewal clears, then access continues uninterrupted.
- Given a user's payment fails, when the retry window begins, then the user is notified and access is maintained during a configurable grace period (3-7 days).
- Given the grace period expires without payment, when the deadline passes, then the account is locked and the user is redirected to a reactivation screen.
- Given a user's subscription is cancelled, when the billing period ends, then access is revoked and the account is locked.
- Given a locked-out user resubscribes, when payment succeeds, then access is restored immediately with all previous data intact.

Tier-Based Feature Limits:
- Given each tier defines a creator limit, when a user attempts to add a creator beyond their allowance, then the action is blocked with a clear upgrade prompt.
- Given each tier defines feature access, when a lower-tier user attempts a gated feature, then they see an upgrade prompt.
- Given a user downgrades, when the new tier has a lower creator limit than their current count, then existing creators are preserved but no new creators can be added until count falls within the new limit.

Webhook & Event Handling:
- Given the payment gateway sends webhooks, when received, then the app processes: subscription created/updated/cancelled, payment succeeded/failed, and invoice finalized.
- Given a webhook is received, when processed, then user access state and tier are updated in real time.
- Given a webhook delivery fails, when the gateway retries, then the application handles duplicate events idempotently.

Admin Visibility:
- Given the team needs oversight, when an admin views the subscription dashboard, then they can see: active subscriptions by tier, accounts in grace period, locked accounts, revenue by tier, and recent failed payments.","- What are the specific pricing tiers and their creator limits and feature gates?
- Should there be a free tier or trial period?
- Is Paddle worth evaluating as primary given it handles merchant-of-record, UK/EU VAT, and SCA compliance out of the box?
- Should locked-out users retain read-only access?
- Do we need mid-cycle upgrades/downgrades with prorated billing?

US-006,Display Rich Post Assets in Creator Dashboard (LinkedIn),Story,"As a logged-in user, I want to see rich media assets alongside post text and engagement data on each creator's profile in the dashboard, so that I can get a complete picture of their content strategy without leaving the application.","Asset Extraction from LinkedIn Posts:
- Given a creator's LinkedIn post contains a single image, when scraped, then the image is extracted and displayed inline with the post.
- Given a post contains a native video, when scraped, then a playable video or thumbnail with ""View on LinkedIn"" fallback is displayed.
- Given a post is a carousel (document/PDF multi-slide), when scraped, then each slide is extracted and displayed in a navigable carousel component maintaining original order.
- Given a post contains a link preview, when scraped, then the preview image, article title, description, and destination URL are displayed as a clickable card.
- Given a post contains a poll, when scraped, then the poll question and options are displayed (with results if publicly visible).

Dashboard Display:
- Given a post includes rich assets, when displayed, then assets render below or alongside post text consistent with LinkedIn's presentation style.
- Given a post has both text and media, when displayed, then engagement metrics remain visible alongside the rich content.
- Given the dashboard displays multiple posts, when posts have different asset types, then each renders its appropriate component without layout breaks.
- Given different screen sizes, when posts with assets are displayed, then asset components are responsive on desktop and tablet.

Thumbnail Generation & Performance:
- Given posts may contain high-resolution media, when the dashboard loads, then optimized thumbnails are displayed initially with full-resolution on click/expand.
- Given a creator may have many posts with media, when the dashboard loads, then assets are lazy-loaded for performance.

Handling Unavailable Assets:
- Given LinkedIn may restrict or expire media URLs, when an asset fails to load, then a graceful placeholder is shown rather than a broken image.
- Given a post's media has been deleted on LinkedIn, when displayed, then text and engagement data are still shown with a note that media is no longer available.

Asset Type Indicators:
- Given the dashboard shows a mix of post types, when viewing the feed, then each post has a subtle type indicator (icon/label for image, video, carousel, article, poll, text-only).","- What is the current scraping method (official API, Proxycurl, PhantomBuster, custom)?
- Are carousel PDFs extracted as individual slide images or downloadable PDF?
- Should users be able to download/export assets, or view-only?
- Do we store assets on our infrastructure or rely on LinkedIn CDN URLs (which may expire)?
- Is there a post history depth currently scraped, and should that change?
- Should this story introduce filtering/sorting by post type?",,,Medium,"linkedin, scraping, dashboard, media-assets"
US-007,AI-Powered Industry/Niche Classification for Creators with Multi-Select Filtering,Story,"As a logged-in user, I want each creator to be automatically categorized by industry/niche based on an AI analysis of their post content, so that I can filter and discover creators by topic relevance rather than relying solely on LinkedIn profile data.","AI-Powered Classification:
- Given a creator has been added and their posts scraped, when sufficient post content is available (min 5 posts), then the system runs an AI classification analyzing post content and recommends one or more industry/niche categories.
- Given the AI analyzes post content, when generating recommendations, then it prioritizes what the creator writes about over their LinkedIn profile headline or job title.
- Given the AI generates recommendations, when presenting them, then each includes a confidence score (high, medium, low).
- Given a creator posts about multiple topics, when classified, then multiple categories are assigned ranked by relevance.

Industry List Management:
- Given Dan has created a master industry list, when the AI classifies creators, then it maps recommendations to categories from this predefined list rather than freeform labels.
- Given the master list exists, when a creator's content doesn't fit any existing category, then the AI flags the creator as ""Uncategorized"" with a suggested new category for review.
- Given the product evolves, when an admin adds/edits/removes industries, then changes are reflected across all existing classifications.

User Review & Override:
- Given the AI has recommended categories, when the user views the creator's profile, then suggested categories are displayed as editable multi-select tags.
- Given the user disagrees with AI suggestions, then they can remove, add, or accept categories from the master list.
- Given a user has manually overridden, when the system re-classifies after new posts, then manual selections are preserved and AI suggestions shown separately as updated recommendations.

Filtering in Dashboard:
- Given creators have been categorized, when the user applies an industry filter, then only creators tagged with the selected industry are displayed.
- Given creators can have multiple categories, when multiple filters are selected, then results show creators matching any selected category (OR logic) with option to switch to AND logic.
- Given filtering is applied, when viewing results, then the user can also filter at the post level — showing only posts relevant to the selected industry.

Re-Classification & Freshness:
- Given a creator's content focus may shift, when new posts are scraped, then the AI periodically re-evaluates (every 30 days or 20 new posts) and surfaces updated recommendations if content has shifted.
- Given re-classification runs, when updated categories differ, then the user is notified with a review prompt rather than auto-changing.","- Can Dan share the current master industry list so it can be seeded into the system?
- What AI model/approach for classification — LLM call (Claude API) or embedding + clustering?
- Should classification run synchronously at creator addition or as a background job?
- How to handle creators with very few posts — skip, ""not enough data"" state, or low-confidence flag?
- Should the confidence score be visible to end users or only used internally?

US-008,AI-Powered Creator Recommendations Based on Industry & Tracked Creators,Story,"As a logged-in user, I want the application to suggest new creators for me to track based on my selected industries and the creators I already follow, so that I can discover relevant voices without manually searching LinkedIn.","Phase 1 — Industry-Based Suggestions (MVP):
- Given a user has selected industries of interest, when they visit the recommendations section, then they are shown suggested creators categorized in those industries.
- Given the engine is surfacing suggestions, when generating the list, then it excludes creators the user is already tracking.
- Given a suggested creator is displayed, when the user views the recommendation card, then it shows: name, LinkedIn headline, industry/niche tags, brief content summary, post frequency, and average engagement metrics.
- Given the user sees a recommendation, when they want to act, then they can add the creator with one click or dismiss with an option to indicate why.
- Given dismissed suggestions are logged, when future recommendations are generated, then dismissed creators are not re-surfaced unless preferences are reset.

Recommendation Source & Pool:
- Given recommendations need a pool, when generating suggestions, then it draws from creators tracked by other users (anonymized) and any curated seed list.
- Given the pool, when suggestions are ranked, then creators with higher post frequency and engagement are prioritized over dormant profiles.

User Industry Preferences:
- Given industry preferences drive recommendations, when a user first signs up, then they are prompted to select industries from the master list (same as US-007).
- Given preferences are set, when updated in settings, then recommendations refresh accordingly.
- Given a user has not set preferences, when they visit recommendations, then they are prompted to select industries before suggestions are shown.

Phase 2 — Similarity-Based Expansion (Future, Architecture-Ready):
- Given phase 1 is designed, when architecture is implemented, then the data model supports future expansion to: content similarity, network proximity, engagement pattern similarity, and collaborative filtering.
- Given phase 2 is not yet implemented, when the recommendation engine is built, then the scoring/ranking layer is abstracted so new signals can be plugged in without rebuilding the pipeline.
- Given the architecture supports future signals, when phase 2 begins, then industry-based score becomes one weighted input alongside new signals.

Display & UX:
- Given recommendations are available, when the user accesses the dashboard, then there is a dedicated ""Suggested Creators"" section.
- Given multiple recommendations are shown, then results are paginated (e.g., 10 at a time) with ""Show more.""
- Given the user adds a suggested creator, when added, then the recommendation list refreshes with the next best suggestion.

Feedback Loop:
- Given user actions on recommendations are valuable, when a user adds or dismisses a suggestion, then that action is logged for analytics (ties into US-002) and used to improve future relevance.","- How do creators enter the recommendation pool — only when tracked by another user, or proactively seeded?
- Should recommendations refresh in real time, daily, or on-demand?
- Minimum tracked creators before similarity-based logic is useful in phase 2?
- Should the recommendation card link to the creator's LinkedIn profile for vetting?
- Do we want an onboarding flow combining industry selection with initial recommendations?",,,Medium,"AI, recommendations, creators, discovery"
